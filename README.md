# CryptoStarter

A DApp to showcase my developer skills on the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. A redesign of the crowdfunding platform 'Kickstarter' on the Rinkeby test network. The DApp has the features of creating a campaign where people can then fund this campaign with ETH. The campaign is completely controlled with a smart contract and the creator can only receive funds after contributors have approved a request.

## Demo
A quick video of me demonstrating the functionality of the [CryptoStarter](https://youtu.be/uegTqVCsoP4) DApp.

## Installation

Please make sure you first have the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension installed so you can interact with the DApp.

## Usage

Please visit [CryptoStarter](https://vdzz7-liaaa-aaaad-qao7q-cai.ic.fleek.co/) and have your MetaMask wallet connected to the Rinkeby test network. You can create your own campaign or contribute to an existing one. By contributing to a campaign you are automatically allocated as an approver of any funds the owner of the campaign wishes to withdraw for their project. To gain this approval at least 50% of the approvers approval is required.

Make sure you are on the Rinkeby test network and have ETH in your MetaMask wallet. If you need ETH you can visit the [Rinkeby Authenticated Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).

Please enjoy the DApp.
