# CryptoStarter

A DApp to showcase my developer skills on the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. A redesign of the crowdfunding platform 'Kickstarter' on the Rinkeby test network. The DApp has the features of creating a campaign where people can then fund this campaign with ETH. The campaign is completely controlled with a smart contract and the creator can only receive funds after contributors have approved a request.
